# Module 1 — Financial Impacts

## Introduction
- This module examines the **financial costs of data breaches**.  
- It also explores **statistics on how prepared organizations are** to defend against cyberattacks.  

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you should be able to:  
- **Describe** the financial impacts of cybercrime on organizations.  
- **Summarize** statistics on organizations’ preparedness for cyberattacks.  

# Cost of Data Breaches — Summary

## Key statistics (2023 IBM/Ponemon Report)
- **$4.45M** — average total cost of a data breach.  
- **$165** — average cost per record of confidential data exposed.  
- **277 days** — mean time to identify and contain a breach (~9 months).  
- **57%** — of organizations increased prices after a breach to offset costs.  
- **$9.48M** — highest average breach cost by region: United States.  
- **$10.93M** — highest average breach cost by industry: Healthcare.  

## Main cost drivers
- **Detection & escalation** — largest contributor, including audits, forensic investigations, and breach detection.  
- **Lost business** — long-term reputational damage leading to customer loss and revenue decline.  
- **Regulatory fines** — particularly severe under the **EU’s GDPR**, which imposes strict data protection requirements and penalties.  

## Overall impact
- Data breaches cause **devastating financial losses** and long-lasting consequences.  
- Rising breach costs are driving growth in the **cybersecurity industry**.  
- With global adoption of data protection laws (e.g., GDPR), **high-profile cases** are expected to increase.  

# Facing the Challenge of Rising Attacks — Summary

## Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2023 (Key Findings)
- **53%** of companies reported a cyberattack — up from 48% the previous year.  
- **$155,000 (median)** — annual spend on cybersecurity, up 39% over three years.  
- **$16,000–$17,000 (median)** — cost per attack, slightly decreased as investments in cybersecurity improved defenses.  
- **1 in 8 attacks** cost more than **$250,000**.  
- **Small businesses (<10 employees):**
  - Cybersecurity spend increased **4x** in two years.  
  - Attack rate still rose from **23% to 36%** over three years.  
- **1 in 3 companies** suffered **payment diversion fraud** (tricking businesses into rerouting payments to attacker-controlled accounts).  
- **1 in 5 companies** received a **ransom demand**.  
  - Ransom payment rate dropped slightly from **66% to 63%**, reflecting better awareness that paying isn’t always effective.  

## Implications
- Cyberattacks are becoming an **unavoidable cost of doing business**.  
- Organizations must improve **cyber resilience** through stronger defenses, better planning, and effective incident response strategies.  
- Professional guidance is critical for ransomware incidents — including data recovery, negotiations, legal compliance, and future prevention.  

## Metaphor
- A cyberattack is like a **pollutant in the environment**:  
  - The accumulation of attacks affects everyone.  
  - Ignoring the problem only makes it worse over time.
