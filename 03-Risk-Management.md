# Module 3: Risk Management

## Introduction
- **Risk** = The possibility of something happening with a **negative consequence**.  
- Risk is part of everyday life and central to many industries.  

**Example ‚Äì Insurance Industry**:  
- Insurers assess **likelihood** of incidents and claims.  
- Premiums are set to balance potential risk vs. financial return.  
- Clients transfer financial risk to insurer via regular payments.  

- **Business Value**: Companies that manage risk effectively gain a **competitive advantage**.  
- In cybersecurity, risk management ensures organizations can protect assets while balancing costs and efficiency.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you will be able to:
1. **Choose the best questions** when determining **risk value**.  
2. **Describe the four responses** organizations can use to address risk.  
3. **Contrast high vs. low risk appetites** and understand their implications.

# Lesson 15: Risk Valuation

## Risk Value Equation
**Risk Value = Consequence √ó Likelihood**

- **Consequence**: The impact and associated damages.  
- **Likelihood**: How often the risk occurs.  

üîπ High consequence + high likelihood = **High Risk** ‚Üí requires immediate attention.  
üîπ Low consequence or low likelihood = **Lower Risk** ‚Üí less urgent.  

---

## Example: Flat Tire
- **Consequence**: Loss of one day of work.  
- **Likelihood**: 1 in 10 cars per year.  
‚û°Ô∏è Overall risk value = **Low**  

---

## Likelihood in Cybersecurity
Likelihood is harder to measure because of evolving tech and outside attackers.  

**Likelihood = Adversary Capability √ó Adversary Motivation √ó Vulnerability Severity**

### Key Terms
1. **Adversary Capability** ‚Äì Skills, resources, and tools attackers can use.  
2. **Adversary Motivation** ‚Äì How determined attackers are to pursue an attack.  
3. **Vulnerability Severity** ‚Äì How easy and impactful it is to exploit a weakness.  

---

## Cybersecurity Example
- **Scenario**: New hacking group targets a bank for login details.  
  - **Adversary Capability**: Low (new group, limited tools).  
  - **Adversary Motivation**: High (multiple attempts possible).  
  - **Vulnerability Severity**: High (well-documented, easy to exploit).  
‚û°Ô∏è Despite low capability, **overall likelihood is significant** due to high motivation and severe vulnerability.

# Risk Response

After assessing risks, organizations decide how to respond. There are **four main responses**:

---

## 1. Acceptance
- The organization **accepts the risk as-is**.  
- A **risk owner** (senior person) acknowledges the consequences and is prepared to deal with them if they occur.  

---

## 2. Reduction
- The organization decides the risk is **too large to accept** and aims to **reduce likelihood or consequence**.  
- Achieved by:  
  - Implementing **security controls**  
  - **Patching vulnerabilities**  

---

## 3. Transference
- The organization **transfers the risk** to a third party.  
- Common methods:  
  - **Insurance**  
  - **Outsourcing**  
- Risk still exists but its **impact is managed by another entity**.  

---

## 4. Rejection
- The organization **rejects the risk completely**.  
- This often requires **changing business operations**, e.g.:  
  - Shutting down sites  
  - Avoiding certain markets or activities  

---

## Example: At-Home Bakery Fire Risk
- **Acceptance**: Rely on baking skills, accept risk of damage, willing to repair kitchen if needed.  
- **Reduction**: Install smoke detector (reduce likelihood) or fire suppression system (reduce consequence).  
- **Transference**: Buy insurance to cover fire damage; pay a premium, insurer covers losses.  
- **Rejection**: Avoid oven baking altogether or don‚Äôt start the bakery business.  

---

## Key Point
Even simple risks have multiple response options. In businesses with rapidly evolving IT, **risk management is ongoing** and critical for both **strategic and tactical decisions**.

# Risk Appetite

**Definition:**  
Risk appetite is the **level of risk an organization is willing to accept**.  

- **High Risk Appetite**: Willing to accept high levels of risk.  
- **Low Risk Appetite**: Prefers to avoid or minimize risk.  

---

## In Cybersecurity
- **High Risk Appetite**:  
  - Takes bold initiatives with new technologies, even if vulnerable.  
  - Pursues competitive advantage.  
  - Accepts the possibility of cyberattacks.  
  - Builds **robust contingencies** for breach response.  

- **Low Risk Appetite**:  
  - Prioritizes stability and reliability over innovation.  
  - Focuses on **protective measures** (e.g., firewalls, encryption, system updates).  
  - Seeks to minimize cyberattack risks, even at the cost of missed opportunities.  

---

## Key Point
- Neither approach is inherently better.  
- An organization‚Äôs risk appetite should:  
  - Align with **strategic goals and resources**.  
  - Adjust based on the **potential impact of cyberattacks** on operations and reputation.
