# Security Strategy — Summary

## Introduction
- Organizations must develop and implement a **security strategy** to defend against cyberattacks.  
- A strong strategy helps **mitigate threats** and improve **preparedness** for potential breaches.  
- This module explains what a security strategy is, explores the concept of **security maturity**, and reviews key frameworks for securing assets.  

## Learning Objectives
After completing this module, you should be able to:  
- **Identify** the components of a comprehensive security strategy.  
- **Describe** each level of the **Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)** for assessing security maturity.  
- **List** the ten steps of the **UK National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) 10 Steps to Cyber Security** framework.  

# Security Strategy — Components

## Definition
- A **security strategy** is an organization’s **well-defined plan** to protect its **digital and physical assets**.  
- It provides structure for how to **prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from threats**.  

## Key Components
- **Risk Assessment** — identifies and evaluates potential threats and vulnerabilities that could impact assets.  
- **Security Policies and Procedures** — establish rules and guidelines for maintaining security across the organization.  
- **Security Awareness and Training** — equips employees with knowledge and skills to prevent breaches.  
- **Incident Response (IR)** — defines actions for preparing, detecting, stopping, and recovering from cyberattacks.  
- **Auditing and Testing** — ensures that security controls and measures are functioning effectively as intended.  

## Responsibility
- Usually developed by an **IT security team** or a **specialized cybersecurity consultant**.  

## Best Practices
- Ideally implemented **as soon as the organization is formed** — but it’s never too late to start.  
- Should be **reviewed and updated annually (or more frequently)** to remain relevant against evolving threats and organizational changes.  

# Security Maturity — Summary

## Definition
- **Security maturity** measures how effectively an organization can **protect assets** and **respond to cyber threats**.  
- Higher maturity = more **advanced, proactive, and integrated** cybersecurity practices.  
- One widely used framework is the **Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)**, developed by public and private sector collaboration.  

## C2M2 Maturity Indicator Levels (MILs)
- **MIL0** — Practices are not performed.  
- **MIL1** — Initial practices exist but are **ad hoc**, reactive, and undocumented.  
- **MIL2** — Practices are **documented, resourced, proactive**, and more advanced than MIL1.  
- **MIL3** — Practices are guided by **policies**, with **clear accountability, skilled personnel**, and **continuous evaluation/improvement**.  

### Characteristics by level
- **MIL0:** No cybersecurity practices.  
- **MIL1:** Practices are reactive and disorganized.  
- **MIL2:** Practices are consistent, documented, and supported by resources.  
- **MIL3:** Cybersecurity is fully integrated into business strategy, with defined roles and continuous improvement.  

## Example — Vulnerability Management (US Department of Energy)
- **MIL1:** Vulnerability discovery and mitigation are **ad hoc**.  
- **MIL2:** Regular assessments, severity ranking, and **evaluated mitigations** for higher-priority assets.  
- **MIL3:** Comprehensive monitoring across IT & OT, **independent assessments**, mitigation effectiveness reviews, and external vulnerability reporting processes.  

## Key takeaway
- Organizations can be at **different maturity levels** in different security areas.  
- Goal: progress from **reactive (MIL1)** → **documented/proactive (MIL2)** → **optimized and strategic (MIL3)**.  

# Marketplace for the Security Industry — Summary

## Overview
- Organizations developing a **security strategy** do not need to start from scratch.  
- A **large marketplace** of cybersecurity products and services is available to support security objectives.  

## Key points
- Most large organizations rely on **multiple vendors** to build layered defenses.  
  - Example: one vendor’s **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) system** + another vendor’s **firewall**.  
- This creates a **vibrant security ecosystem**, which includes:  
  - **Cybersecurity vendors** (products and services)  
  - **Standards authorities** (frameworks, guidelines, best practices)  
  - **Charities and non-profits** (awareness, education, research)  
  - **Government entities** (regulations, enforcement, national cybersecurity initiatives)  

## Takeaway
- The cybersecurity marketplace provides organizations with **tools, expertise, and frameworks** to strengthen their defenses and align with industry standards.
