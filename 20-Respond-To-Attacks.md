# Incident Response

The **SANS Institute** provides many educational courses, events, and online resources relating to cybersecurity, including an industry-standard framework for incident response. This framework consists of **six phases**.  

---

## Phase 1: Preparation

- Organizations plan what they will do when an incident occurs.  
- Typical steps: preparing resources, defining procedures, and testing readiness.  

---

## Phase 2: Identification

- The security team detects a potential security event.  
- The incident response protocol is initiated.  
- The team investigates to confirm whether the event is an **actual security incident** or a **false alarm**.  

---

## Phase 3: Containment

- The team works to prevent the situation from worsening.  
- Typical actions: segregating networks, shutting down access routes, or isolating affected systems.  

---

## Phase 4: Eradication

- The team removes the presence and impact of malware or attackers.  
- Actions may include wiping devices, reimaging, or restoring systems to safe states.  
- Incomplete eradication can cause malware to **re-emerge**, so thoroughness is critical.  

---

## Phase 5: Recovery

- The organization returns to **normal operations**.  
- Typical actions: removing temporary fixes and restoring services.  

---

## Phase 6: Reflection

- The security team and stakeholders reflect on the incident’s cause and the response’s effectiveness.  
- This stage is often called **lessons learned**, though a better title might be **lessons identified** if no changes are made.  

---

## Example

For a **data breach from a lost storage device**:  
- The **eradication phase** may be quick (removing access to the device).  
- The **recovery phase** may take longer, requiring engagement from multiple stakeholders to restore security and trust.  

# Testing Preparedness

As part of standard business activities, many organizations conduct simulated activities to test their level of preparation. These typically include:  

- **Paper-based tests**  
- **Tabletop exercises**  
- **Live tests**  

---

## Paper-Based Tests

- Security teams complete surveys about their level of preparation.  
- Common tasks:  
  - Identifying key personnel  
  - Explaining how to create proper backups  
  - Demonstrating how to produce process documents upon request  

---

## Tabletop Exercises

- A more involved format than paper-based tests.  
- Key personnel gather to **simulate the incident response process end-to-end**.  
- Benefits:  
  - Teams interact with one another  
  - Provides insight into how broader scenarios develop  

---

## Live Tests

- The most **realistic form of testing**.  
- Conducted in **live systems**.  
- Organizations may shut down critical systems to test failures and team responses.  
- Provides the most accurate view of how teams handle real-world incidents.  

# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)

In the context of **incident response**, two important terms are:  

- **Business continuity**  
- **Disaster recovery**  

These concepts often overlap with other security functions and are essential for organizational resilience.  

---

## Business Continuity

- Refers to an organization’s ability to **continue operating despite an incident**.  
- Example:  
  - Backup sites that take over delivery of services  
  - Backup technology systems that step in if one fails  

---

## Disaster Recovery

- Refers to an organization’s ability to **recover after a disaster**.  
- Example:  
  - If a disaster wipes all computers or deletes entire databases, recovery planning ensures the organization can **restart from virtually nothing**.  

---

## Modern Context

- Historically, continuity planning focused on **natural disasters** (floods, earthquakes, fires).  
- Today, **cyberattacks can be equally or more disruptive**.  
  - Example: A cyberattack that shuts down organizational file shares or domain management systems across global sites.  
- Effective planning ensures both **continuity of operations** and **recovery from catastrophic events**.  

# Benefit of Incident Response Teams

Organizations benefit greatly from having **incident response teams** in place. A well-prepared response plan can save both time and money.  

---

## Cost Savings

According to the **Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023**:  

- Organizations **with incident response capabilities** had an average breach cost of **USD 3.62 million**.  
- Organizations **without incident response capabilities** had an average breach cost of **USD 5.11 million**.  
- That’s a **difference of USD 1.49 million**, or about **34% lower costs** when an incident response team is present.  

---

## Key Takeaway

Incident response teams not only improve security resilience but also provide **tangible financial benefits** by reducing the overall cost and impact of breaches.
