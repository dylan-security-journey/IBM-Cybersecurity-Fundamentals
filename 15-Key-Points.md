1. **Threat actor groups (5 main types):**  
   - Script kiddie  
   - Hacktivist  
   - Criminal gang  
   - Nation-state hacker  
   - Malicious insider  

2. These groups differ in **motivation, resources, and techniques**.  

3. **Common attack types:** denial-of-service (DoS), malware, man-in-the-middle (MitM), and DNS attacks.  

4. **AI in attacks:** enables automation (e.g., mass phishing campaigns) and increases attack sophistication.  

5. **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain®:** outlines attacks in **7 stages** to help professionals detect and prevent them.  

6. **MITRE ATT&CK matrix:** maps attacker **tactics and techniques**, helping anticipate next moves.  

7. **Cryptocurrencies in cybercrime:** chosen for **anonymity and decentralization**, making law enforcement tracking difficult.  

8. **Defending against social engineering:** focus on the **three pillars of cybersecurity** — education, process, and technology.  

9. **Phishing red flags:** generic greetings, unusual requests, suspicious links.  

10. **OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):** easier and cheaper to gather than traditional intelligence.  

11. **Common OSINT sources:** blogs, news sites, and other publicly available platforms.  

12. **Technical scanning:** used by both defenders and attackers to assess system/network security posture.  

13. **High-profile incidents:** provide valuable lessons to improve future cybersecurity decision-making.
