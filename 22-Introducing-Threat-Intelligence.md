# What is Threat Intelligence?

To understand **threat intelligence**, you must first understand the broader concept of **intelligence**.  

According to the **UK Ministry of Defence**:  

> Intelligence is the product resulting from the directed collection and processing of information regarding the environment and the capabilities and intentions of actors in order to identify threats and other opportunities for exploitation by decision-makers.

## Threat Intelligence

**Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI)**, or simply threat intelligence, is:  
- Data collected and analyzed by an organization  
- Used to understand the **motives** and **behavior** of threat actors  
- Typically focused on **attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)** and **indicators of compromise (IoCs)**  

---

## Key Terms

### Tactics (The **Why**)
- The adversary’s **goal or reason** for performing an action.  
- Example: An adversary wants to **increase privileges**.  

### Techniques (The **How**)  
- The **methods** an adversary uses to achieve a tactical goal.  
- Example: An adversary bypasses access controls to increase privileges.  

### Procedures (The **What Exactly**)  
- The **specific implementation** or tool used for a technique.  
- Example: An adversary uses a particular program or exploit to elevate privileges.  

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)  
- **Signatures** or evidence of attacker activity.  
- Examples:  
  - Known malicious IP addresses  
  - Suspicious files or hashes  
- Presence of an IoC can indicate that an organization has already been compromised.  

---

## Key Takeaway

Threat intelligence provides context and actionable insights into **who attackers are**, **how they operate**, and **what signs to watch for**, enabling organizations to strengthen defenses and respond proactively.  

# Benefits of Threat Intelligence

Organizations can benefit from **threat intelligence** across several key areas:  

---

## Providing a Warning

- Helps organizations **prepare for attacks** before they occur.  
- Geopolitical or technical developments can rapidly change an organization’s risk profile.  
- With advance notice, defenses can be adjusted to **prevent attacks proactively**.  

---

## Providing Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

- Threat intelligence enhances **detection activities** by supplying IoCs.  
- Examples of IoCs include:  
  - Malicious IP addresses  
  - File hashes  
  - Domains linked to attackers  
- Security analysts can **search for these indicators** and create rules to trigger alerts when they are detected.  

---

## Providing Context

- Intelligence helps organizations understand attackers, even if their identity is initially unknown.  
- Provides **attribution clues** and **insight into expected behavior**.  
- Context helps shape better defenses and response strategies.  

---

## Learning from Peers

- Organizations can share:  
  - How attackers targeted them  
  - How they defended themselves  
  - How effective their approaches were  
- Sharing lessons learned helps **strengthen the security posture of the entire industry**.  

# Sources of Threat Intelligence

Gathering and developing **threat intelligence** can be complex.  
Organizations may collect information directly or rely on external sources.  
Here are some common sources of threat intelligence:  

---

## Threat Exchange Platforms

- Online platforms provide **databases of gathered information and analysis**.  
- Some are freely available, while others require subscriptions or are limited to industry groups.  
- **Example:** [IBM X-Force Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com)  

---

## Conferences

- Cybersecurity conferences allow professionals to **share the latest industry developments**.  
- Researchers sometimes **withhold discoveries** until a conference for greater visibility.  
- Conferences also provide opportunities for **informal conversations and networking**.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Black Hat  
  - RSA Conference  
  - CYBERUK  

---

## Articles and News

- Specialized media outlets and blogs provide continuous **coverage of cybersecurity developments**.  
- Traditional and niche sites cater to cybersecurity professionals.  
- **Examples:**  
  - [Security Intelligence](https://securityintelligence.com)  
  - [Krebs on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com)  
  - [Graham Cluley](https://grahamcluley.com)  

---

## Product Vendors

- Major software vendors release **periodic security advisories**.  
- These advisories often include **critical vulnerability information** and are essential for system administrators.  
- **Examples:** Microsoft, Google, Apple.  

---

## Key Takeaway

Using **multiple sources**—platforms, conferences, media, and vendor advisories—gives organizations a **well-rounded picture of threats**, helping them stay proactive in defending against attackers.  

# Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Threat Intelligence

Computer systems can gather and process data much faster than humans, making **artificial intelligence (AI)** especially valuable for obtaining threat intelligence.  
Here are several types of AI-enabled threat intelligence applications:  

---

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- **NLP systems** can automatically recognize and extract key data points about threats.  
- Works with **unstructured data** (e.g., images, text, social media feeds, news articles).  
- Conventional tools struggle with unstructured data, but NLP can parse it effectively.  
- Helps organizations stay **up to date on IoCs** and attack methods.  

---

## Threat Intelligence Sharing

- Cyber defense requires **collaboration and sharing** of intelligence between organizations.  
- Traditional methods are **manual and time-consuming**.  
- With AI:  
  - Threat intelligence sharing can be **automated**.  
  - AI ensures relevant threat details are shared **without exposing sensitive data** (PII, strategic plans, confidential info).  

---

## Predictive Analytics

- **Predictive analytics** combines historical data with statistical modeling and machine learning to forecast outcomes.  
- AI enhances predictive analytics by building more effective models.  
- Enables organizations to **anticipate and mitigate threats before they occur**.  

---

## Key Takeaway

AI strengthens threat intelligence by:  
- Processing unstructured data at scale (NLP)  
- Enabling safe and automated intelligence sharing  
- Powering predictive models that forecast future threats
