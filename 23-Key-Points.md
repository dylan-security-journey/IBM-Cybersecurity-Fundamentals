# Key Points to Remember

1. The biggest contributor to the cost of a data breach is **detection and escalation**, followed by **lost business**.  

2. A comprehensive security strategy includes:  
   - Risk assessment  
   - Policies and procedures  
   - Awareness and training  
   - Incident response  
   - Auditing and testing  

3. The more advanced an organization’s security protocols and strategies, the greater its **security maturity**.  

4. Common strategies for preventing attacks include:  
   - Reducing the **attack surface**  
   - Following the **principle of least privilege**  
   - Managing **software vulnerabilities**  
   - Using **defense in depth**  

5. Standard methods for detecting attacks include:  
   - Antimalware software  
   - Logging  
   - Network monitoring  
   - Security information and event management (SIEM) tools  
   - Security operations centers (SOCs)  

6. **Artificial intelligence (AI)** can enhance attack detection, such as by reducing **false positives**.  

7. The **SANS Institute’s incident response framework** includes six phases:  
   - Preparation  
   - Identification  
   - Containment  
   - Eradication  
   - Recovery  
   - Reflection  

8. Secure, reliable communications have three properties:  
   - **Confidentiality**  
   - **Authenticity**  
   - **Integrity**  

9. In **symmetric encryption**, the same key is used for encryption and decryption.  
   In **asymmetric encryption**, a **public key** encrypts data and a **private key** decrypts it.  

10. Organizations will need **quantum-safe encryption** to defend against **quantum computing attacks**.  

11. Threat intelligence benefits organizations by providing **warnings**, identifying **indicators of compromise (IoCs)**, and aiding **contextual understanding** of attacks.  

12. Common sources of threat intelligence include **media outlets** and **threat exchange platforms** (e.g., IBM X-Force Exchange).
